    "There are 3 data types that we will be exploring this week. They are `int`, `float`, and `str`. The `int` data type refers to any integer such as 1, -7, or 93. The `float` data type is short for floating decimal and refers to any real number (within a certain range of values) represented as a decimal.  For example, -2.0, 19.33, or 3.14159 have float type. The `str` data type refers to string of characters. Characters include letters, numerical digits, common punctuation marks (such as \".\" or \"-\"), and whitespace. Strings will be surrounded by `' '`, `\" \"`, `''' '''`, or `\"\"\" \"\"\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use a type conversion function to convert from one type to another, for example, from an integer to a float or string or from a float to an integer or string. Only certain strings can be converted to an integer or float. If the string contains anything other than numbers, a `ValueError` will occur. This type of error occurs when you pass a parameter to a function that is a data type it is not expecting. For example, `float('3.882GPA')` will produce such an error since the letters GPA cannot be converted to a float. Later on in the course we will learn how to use `string methods` to manipulate strings to suit our purposes. For now, we will just explore a couple of the basics."
